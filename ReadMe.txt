This program uses the SIR model with a local turtle library. It has the ability to change inputs such the infection radius, use of masks, infection chance, average recovery time, etc. The program has no user interface at this point so to run a new simulation with different values it would have to be put in a console or the source code would have to be edited. This program is designed to run different experiments with different values to emulate real life virus spread and provide meaningful data. At the end of the program it will output 3 different graphs that show how the changed variables (step value) affect the population pool. It will not run without the local installation of turtle python that is not publically accsessible.
